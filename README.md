# Sitepoint Junior FrontEnd Test

Created a simple counter application that can do the following:

- Add a named counter to a list of counters
- Increment any of the counters
- Decrement any of the counters
- Delete a counter
- Show a sum of all the counter values

Sitepoint included the Bulma (https://bulma.io/documentation/) CSS lib to help me with the style.
